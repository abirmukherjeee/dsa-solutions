🧠 DSA Playbook: Mastery through Intuition
A curated collection of Data Structures and Algorithms solutions, focused on deep understanding, visual dry runs, and clean implementation.

📌 Purpose
This repository is my personal knowledge base for DSA. Instead of just "solving" problems, the goal here is to document the why and how behind every solution to make revision efficient and patterns recognizable.

📂 Repository Structure
Each problem is housed in its own directory within a category folder.

🛠️ Problem Documentation Template
Every README.md follows a consistent structure to ensure high-quality revision:
1. Problem Statement: Brief description and link.
2. Intuition: The core logic/pattern (e.g., Sliding Window, Two Pointers).
3. Approach: Step-by-step breakdown.
4. Visual Dry Run: Trace tables or diagrams showing state changes.
5. Complexity Analysis: Time O(n) and Space O(n).

🚀 How to Use
1. Browse by Topic: Navigate to a specific folder (e.g., /01-arrays).
2. Read the Logic: Open the .md file to understand the intuition and see the dry run.
3. Run the Code: `python 01-arrays/01-two_sum/solution.py`
