# DSA Solutions Repository

This repository contains my personal collection of Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) solutions, created for revision, pattern recognition, and long-term reference.

Each problem is structured to capture not just the final code, but also the intuition, approach, dry runs, and complexity analysis, so that revisiting a solution months later is effortless.

## 📂 Repository Structure

Problems are organized by topic, and each problem has its own folder.

```text

## 📄 Problem Folder Structure

Each problem folder contains:

- **README.md**
  - Problem statement
  - Intuition
  - Approach
  - Visual / tabular dry run
  - Code discussion
  - Complexity analysis
  - Edge cases

- **solution.py / solution.java**
  - Clean, interview-ready implementation
  - Optional sample test case

---

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

- One problem = one folder
- Explanation and code are separated
- Focus on patterns, not memorization
- Content optimized for quick revision
- GitHub-friendly (Markdown-first)

---

## ▶️ How to Run a Solution (Python)

```bash
cd 01-arrays/01-two_sum
python solution.py
```

---

## 🏷 Tags & Patterns

Each problem includes tags such as:

- HashMap
- Sliding Window
- Two Pointers
- Dynamic Programming
